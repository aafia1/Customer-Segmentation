# 🛍️ Task 2: Customer Segmentation  

## 📌 Internship  
This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways**.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
The goal of this task is to perform **customer segmentation** based on annual income and spending score.  
By applying clustering algorithms, businesses can better understand customer groups and improve marketing strategies.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
- Recommended: [Mall Customers Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- Contains features like Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – handled missing values and scaled features.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – visualized customer distribution.  
3. **Optimal Clusters** – used Elbow Method to determine the best K value.  
4. **Model Training** – applied K-Means clustering to group customers.  
5. **Visualization** – plotted customer clusters on 2D graphs.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📚 Covered Topics  
- Clustering  
- Unsupervised Learning  

## 🌟 Bonus Experiments  
- Tested other clustering algorithms (e.g., **DBSCAN**).  
- Analyzed **average spending per cluster** to gain business insights.  

## 🚀 How to Run
